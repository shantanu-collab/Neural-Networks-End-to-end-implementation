This repository has all the materials relevant to Neural Networks, starting from implementation of logistic regression with neural network frame of mind to implementation of neural networs (shallow and deep)
After, understanding the technical nitty gritties of implementation we will use Keras library to implement neural networks and will decide when it is favourable to use them and when to use other ML models
